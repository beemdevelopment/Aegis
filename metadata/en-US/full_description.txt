Aegis Authenticator is a free, secure and open source app to manage your
2-step verification tokens for your online services.

<b>Encryption</b>
All of your one-time passwords are stored in a vault. If you choose
to set a password, which is highly recommended, the vault will be encrypted
using AES-256. If someone with malicious intent gets a hold of the vault file,
itâ€™s impossible for them to retrieve the contents without knowing the password.

<b>Fingerprint unlock</b>
Entering your password each time you need access to a
one-time password can be cumbersome. Fortunately, you can also enable
fingerprint unlock if your device has a fingerprint scanner.

<b>Compatibility</b>
Aegis supports the HOTP and TOTP algorithms. These two algorithms are
industry-standard and widely supported, making Aegis compatible with
thousands of services. Some examples are: Google, GitHub, Dropbox, Facebook
and Instagram.

It is also compatible with Google Authenticator. Any website that shows a QR
code for Google Authenticator also works with Aegis.

<b>Groups</b>
Have a lot of one-time passwords? Add them to custom groups for easier
access. Personal, Work and Social can each get their own group.

<b>Backups</b>
To make sure you will never lose access to your online accounts Aegis
Authenticator supports exporting your vault which you can import onto a new
device. Aegis Authenticator also allows you to import AndOTP and FreeOTP
databases so switching to Aegis is made easier for you.
