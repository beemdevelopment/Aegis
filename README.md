APK releases on Google Play and GitHub are signed using the same key. They can
be verified using

```
apksigner verify --print-certs --verbose aegis.apk
```

The output should look like:

```

### Icon packs

Aegis supports icon packs to make it easier to assign icons to the entries in
your vault. There are no official icon packs, but the community maintains a
number of third-party icon packs you may want to check out. To learn how to
create your own Aegis-compatible icon pack, see [the
documentation](docs/iconpacks.md).

- [aegis-icons](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons)

  Unofficial monochrome-styled 2FA icons.

  [<img width=500 alt="aegis-icons preview"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/master/showcase.png">](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons)

- [aegis-simple-icons](https://github.com/alexbakker/aegis-simple-icons) *

  This project periodically generates an icon pack for Aegis based on [Simple
  Icons](https://simpleicons.org/).

- [aegis-simple-icons-outlined](https://github.com/michaelschattgen/aegis-simple-icons-outlined) *

  This is a variant on the aegis-simple-icons pack where the icons contain no solid background and just the outlines are being used.
 
\* The icons are automatically generated, so
  not all of them are as high quality as the ones you'll find in
  [aegis-icons](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons).
